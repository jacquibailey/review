<h1>
My review of "The Force Awakens"
</h1>

<img src="poster.jpg" />


<p>
I am writing this review for you because I was asked to in my English class at Virginia Tech. I heard you haven't seen the new Star Wars movie, and I haven't either, but I'm going to make up things for you. Please enjoy. </p>

<p>As I was saying, I have not seen this movie yet. But you should go see it. I've heard great things. My parents saw it after I came back to school because I told them I didn't really care that much about seeing it. It's not that I don't like Star Wars, I just didn't think it was that big of a deal to see it before I left to come back to Virginia Tech. That's not a crime, right?
 </p>

<h2> The Cast </h2>

<ul>
<li>John Boyega</li>

<li>That girl, Rey?</li>
<li>Luke, maybe, not positive </li>
<li>Chewy</li>
<li>Harrison Ford is old and rich now</li>
<li>So is Princess Leia</li>
</ul>

<h2> Why I Didn't See the Movie</h2>

<ol>
<li>I didn't feel like it</li>
<li>I didn't care enough</li>
<li>My boyfriend saw it without me
<ul>He saw it on opening night</ul>
<ul>With his friends</ul>
<ul>Just because</ul>
</li>
<li>Money</li>
</ol>

<h2> My Feelings on the Film</h2>

<p> So now I am wondering when I am going to see the movie. Will I wait until I can rent it on Netflix? That sounds tempting. We already pay for Netflix. Well, I don't, but you get what I mean. It's still free. Unless my parents decide to stop paying for the actual mail service of Netflix, which, to be honest, they probably should do. There are so many things to stream for free that they're already paying for! But it does take even longer for released movies to come out into the streaming part of Netflix. </p>
  <p> So, anyway, I was forced to watch the original movies a couple summers ago, so it's not like I'm the biggest fan. I've seen some headlines of articles that spoil the movie a little. Maybe not. But I keep seeing a few articles that say, "Why Rey is not Luke's daughter." But I really don't know anything yet. Just a lot of article headlines about that girl. She looks like Kiera Knightly. I don't know if I spelled that right. Let me know.</p>

  <h2> Other Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Rotten Tomatoes gave the movie an overall 93%. On average, their users gave it a 4.4/5, a 90%. Out of all of their reviews, they had 306 fresh and 24 rotten from users. Not bad! That's very good.</li>
<li>Metacritic gave the film an 81%</li>
<li>The Guardian gave "The Force Awakens" a 5/5</li>


    </ol>

  <h2> The Theater</h2>

  <p> I have been to the Alamo movie theater a couple times and it is pretty amazing. The food isn't the best food I've ever eaten, but it's good! It's just nice to eat while you're watching a movie. I don't know how that got started in our culture, but people love eating during a movie. So I saw Jurassic World at the Alamo and I saw Sisters there. I tried different food the second time and I got chicken tenders. They were spicy but I couldn't drink too much water or else I would have to get up during the movie to go to the bathroom. </p>
